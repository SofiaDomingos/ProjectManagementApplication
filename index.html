              Regarding the uncertainties about career opportunities of the new academic training that was Criminology in 2008, I chose to enter in an IT training at FCUP, an area in which I had great interest and fascination. However, in 2010 I interrupted this training to graduate and master in Criminology from FDUP, where I developed a deep interest for scientific research and safety issues.<br>
              <br>
              Although I'm feeling fulfilled at an academic level, I understand along this path that my professional wish is to recover the IT area and, if possible, reconcile it with my training in the social sciences. To this end, I have sought to acquire and develop knowledge in the area of Project Management, Scrum and RGPD at self-taught level.<br>      
              <br>

              CCP holder, I have provided training services to IEFP (Gaia Training Service) during one year and seven months, developing training courses in several areas like criminology, behavioral, administrative and entrepreneurship and vocational guidance. As a trainer, in addition to the regular preparation of training support manuals and technical documentation (session plans, technical-pedagogical dossiers, among others), I have had the opportunity to be responsible for mediating some classes and continually improving my personal and professional skills.<br>
              <br>
              I got the chance to become IT Recruiter in Aubay Portugal where I had the opportunity to contact with highly qualified professionals on a daily basis, doing national and international recruitment.<br>
              <br>
              Recently I had the chance to join META, as Tech Recruiter, participating in the construction of recruitment processes, flows and puting in practice several ideas to improve the chances to get the best professionals on the IT field. <br>

              <b>But why should you choose me?</b>
              <br>
              Although I don't have previous professional experience as a Project Manager (even if I believe that you are not expecting it!) I have the right mindset and proactivity for guarantee the position and get the job done! <br>
              <br>
              Going further in the main responsabilities that you present in the announcement:<br>
              <br>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Outline a project workflow plan</b></li>I believe that I'm capable of that since I had similar experiences in my past related with master's thesis and even in Aubay and META; I'm comfortable with design of workflows and critical thinking about the pros and cons in a project
                <li><b>Coordinate working groups and their training</b></li>Again, my previous experience in Instituto de Emprego e FormaÃ§Ã£o Profissional is a great example of this; I had the chance to work with people from diverse backgrounds and ages and even coordinate other trainers as a mediator in some classes, being responsible for guarantee the right functionality of the classes, the achievment of the goals initially established for the professional path, the remove of impediments and mediation of problems. 
                <li><b>Ensure that the contents are prepared by teams/individuals</b></li>Although I'm not an experied professional in leadership of teams, in my professional background I faced the need of get the things done with other people; I consider myself a very organized and responsible person that is able to influence others in a positive way to achieve goals; currently I'm enrolled in the task force responsible to put our international recruitment process on track and I love this kind of challenges. 
                <li><b>Establish protocols with external entities</b></li>I confess that I don't have experience in this field, despite being very curious about the business contacts part of a project. 
                <li><b>Assist in the definition of profiles of trainees and trainers</b></li>In the past I helped in recruitment processes for other teams, and I consider myself a very analytical person, capable of recognize qualities, flaws, and look at the big picture, believing that everyone is capable of improve. 
                <li><b>Coordinate the respective Marketing actions together with Sofia</b></li>In the last two months I had the chance to contact directly with Sofia in order to discuss some ideas and ask for help, and it's being a great experience. 
                <li><b>Budget management</b></li>Again, I don't have professional experience in this one. I had some contact with concepts of Project Management like Gantt Diagram and MS Project that I got in Project Management + MS Project Course from Gustavo Farias on Udemy (I have currently 60% of the course concluded). However, I'm still very interested in know more about this topics.
